      "My personal website that I built in order to play around with some new technologies that I wanted an excuse to use. This website replaces my old website that I built during my first year of University, which was beginning to show signs of aging. I really enjoyed the process of creating this website and working alongside my friend Luke who designed the layout for me.",
      "For the backend of the project, I decided to use Next.js in combination with Typescript. I had used vanilla React.js at a previous place of work, however I had never used Typescript. A lot of my previous experience with programming comes from typed languages, and I can really appreciate the benefits that Typescript adds to a Javascript project.",
      "This project was a great experience for me that exposed me to a bunch of new technologies, and more importantly kept me occupied during COVID-19."
